## Installing Language Servers

Language servers are not automatically installed. A language server must be
installed for every language you would like to support. That is easy as running
`:LspInstall <language>`. Here is a recommended list of languages.

    - html
    - typescript (this also supports Javascript, React, etc)
    - php
    - bash
    - json
    - lua
    - prismals
    - rust
