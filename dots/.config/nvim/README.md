## Installing Language Servers

Language servers are not automatically installed. A language server must be
installed for every language you would like to support. That is easy as running
`:LspInstall <language>`. Here is a recommended list of language servers.

    - intelephense (PHP)
    - tsserver (Javascript flavors)
    - lua-language-server (Lua)
    - eslint (Javascript flavors)
    - html (HTML)
    - bashls (Bash scripting)
    - prismals (Prisma ORM)
    - cssls (CSS)
    - jsonls (JSON)
